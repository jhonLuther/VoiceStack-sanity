<p class="legal__text">
  Similar to other websites, we use tracking technologies to automatically
  collect certain technical information from your web browser, mobile, or other
  device when you visit our Site. This data may include, without limitation,
  your IP address, browser type and language, referring/exit pages and URLs,

<p class="legal__text">
  We automatically derive and collect certain data based on your interactions

  “Cookies”). Our collection of data through Cookies includes information about
  your browser and Site usage patterns, which may include your IP address,
  browser type, browser language, referring/exit pages and URLs, pages viewed,
  links clicked, whether you opened an email, and information about the device
  you use to access the Site. Our collection of this information allows us to
  improve your user experience in various ways, such as to personalize our

  deliver Cookies on our Site, or count users who have visited the Site. We may
  also include web beacons in our promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to
  determine whether you open or act on them for statistical purposes. “Pixels”
  are tiny graphics (about the size of a period at the end of a sentence) with
  unique identifiers used to track certain online actions, movements and related
  information of Site users. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on a user’s
  computer hard drive, Pixels are embedded invisibly on web pages or in

  promote the Site to various populations of users, and to optimize external
  advertisements about the Site that appear on third-party websites.

  to your account information or other information we have collected. We, and
  the third parties we engage, may combine information we collect from you over

<p class="legal__text">
  We collect precise geolocation data from you or your device, as well as your

  experience to the region where you are located.

<p class="legal__text">
  We reserve the right to disclose all information collected via the Site,
  internally, to affiliates, or to third parties, for any lawful purpose or to
  prevent harm to us or others. For example, and without limitation, in our
  discretion we may disclose information to government regulators, law

<h3 class="legal__section-sub-title">5.4. Organizational Transitions.</h3>
<p class="legal__text">
  If we should ever transfer or restructure the operational ownership of the
  Site, such as through a merger with another entity or a reorganization of all
  or a part of our operational responsibilities or assets, we may disclose,
  transfer, assign our rights, and/or delegate our duties to your information
  without notice and consent, including to prospective or actual recipient or
  acquiring entities. Should this occur, we will require any third party

<h3 class="legal__section-sub-title">5.5. Disclaimer</h3>
<p class="legal__text">
  We cannot ensure that all of your Personal Information will be disclosed only

<p class="legal__text">
  You may have the right under the CCPA to request that we delete any of your

  certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer
  request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your

<ul class="legal__list--bullet-point">

  </li>
  <li>

    research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics

    impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously
    provided informed consent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer
    expectations based on your relationship with us.

<h3 class="legal__section-sub-title">6.5. Right to Opt-Out.</h3>
<p class="legal__text">
  If you are 16 years of age or older, you may have the right under the CCPA to
  direct us not to make your Personal Information available for valuable
  consideration at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not make available
  the Personal Information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years
  of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”)
  from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent
  or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in may
  opt-out at any time.
</p>
<p class="legal__text">
  To exercise the right to opt-out please complete this form:

  authorized representative) may submit a request to us by sending us an e-mail
  at <a href="mailto:privacyconcerns@voicestack.com">privacyconcerns@voicestack.com</a>
  or, once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months
  before asking you to reauthorize certain information sharing practices.
  However, you may change your mind and opt back in at any time by sending us an
  e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacyconcerns@voicestack.com">privacyconcerns@voicestack.com</a>. We will only use Personal Information provided in an opt-out request to
  review and comply with the request.
</p>
<h3 class="legal__section-sub-title">6.6. Exercising Your Rights.</h3>
<p class="legal__text">
  To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above,
  please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
</p>
<p class="legal__text">
  Visiting <a href="https://www.voicestack.com/legal/2024-10/accessordeletionrequest">https://www.voicestack.com/legal/2024-10/accessordeletionrequest</a>

</p>
<p class="legal__text">
  Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that
  you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request
  related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer
  request on behalf of your minor child.
</p>
<p class="legal__text">
  You may only make such a request for access or data portability twice within a
  twelve-month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient
  information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom
  we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative, and
  describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly
  understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
</p>
<p class="legal__text">
  We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if
  we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm
  the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request
  does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal
  Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
  requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
</p>
<p class="legal__text">
  We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45)
  days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will
  inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our
  written response electronically. Any disclosures we provide will only cover
  the twelve (12) month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s
  receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot
  comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will
  select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable
  and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another
  entity without hindrance.
</p>
<p class="legal__text">
  We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer
  request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we
  determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that
  decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
</p>
<h3 class="legal__section-sub-title">6.7. Non-Discrimination.</h3>
<p class="legal__text">
  We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
  Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
</p>
<ul class="legal__list--bullet-point">
  <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
  <li>
    Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including
    through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
  </li>
  <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
  <li>
    Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services
    or a different level or quality of goods or services.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="legal__text">
  However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA
  that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any
  CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your
  Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the
  program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program
  requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

  Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies, but you can reset your
  browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
  However, some features and services of the Site (particularly those that
  require sign-in) may not function properly if your Cookies are disabled.
  Similarly, if you choose to delete session objects from our Site, you may not
  be able to access and use all or part of the site or benefit from some or all

<p class="legal__text">
  Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that
  signals to websites that a user does not want to have the user’s online
  activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT
  signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from
  collecting certain information about that browser’s user. Not all browsers
  offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many
  websites, including the Site, do not respond to DNT signals.

  7. SAFETY AND INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES.
</h2>
<h3 class="legal__section-sub-title">7.1. Security.</h3>
<p class="legal__text">
  We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to
  preserve the security of your information that we maintain in connection with
  your use of the Site. For example, we encrypt all data with secure sockets
  layer (SSL) or similar technologies when we transmit your data. This, however,
  does not guarantee that your information may not be accessed, disclosed,
  altered, or destroyed by any breach of our physical, technical or managerial
  safeguards. In the event that any of your Personal Information under our
  control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take
  reasonable steps to investigate the situation and will notify you, as
  appropriate, in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.

<h3 class="legal__section-sub-title">7.2. Storage.</h3>
<p class="legal__text">
  We or our third party hosting providers store Personal Information in
  operating environments that are safeguarded against public or unauthorized
  access and protected from internal access with physical and technical security
  measures. While these measures are helpful to safeguard your Personal
  Information after we receive it, no transmission of data over the internet is
  100% secure.
