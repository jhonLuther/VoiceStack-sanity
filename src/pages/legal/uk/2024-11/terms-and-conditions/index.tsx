              <span className="c1">
                . Customer may terminate this Agreement during a term only for
                Cause. &ldquo;Cause&rdquo; means any uncured material breach of
                the terms of this Agreement after giving 30 days prior written
                notice by the nonbreaching party to the breaching party. In the
                event the Customer terminates this Order form for any reason
                whatsoever, before completion of the term from the Effective
                Date, Customer shall pay applicable early termination charges.
                For termination prior to installation of Service and after
                execution of this Agreement, early termination charges shall be
                those reasonable expenses incurred by VoiceStack through the
                date of termination. If there is termination after activation of
                Service, Customer shall be obligated as follows: to pay an early
                termination charge equivalent to the highest monthly invoice
                value billed to the Customer under this Order form multiplied by
                the number of months remaining in the term of the Agreement; to
                pay VoiceStack for Services actually received; to repay
                VoiceStack for any credits, discounts, or waived installation
                costs received in anticipation of a long-term Agreement; and to
                reimburse VoiceStack for the reasonable costs it incurred in
                setting up Customer&rsquo;s Service (including the costs of any
                equipment installed and not returned in &quot;as new&quot;
                condition). Customer agrees that VoiceStack&rsquo;s damages for
                early termination would be difficult to determine, and the
                termination charge(s) constitutes a reasonable estimate of
                appropriate liquidated damages and that such is not intended as
                a penalty. In all cases where this Agreement is terminated and
                Customer is using telephone numbers originally assigned by
                VoiceStack, Customer understands and agrees that those telephone
                numbers will not be released to another service provider until
                all undisputed charges owing to VoiceStack are paid.
