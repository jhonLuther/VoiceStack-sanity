                        acknowledges that Customer has read, and is familiar with, VoiceStack&rsquo;s Acceptable Use Policy
                        (&quot;AUP&quot;) as mentioned below and incorporated by this reference. Customer hereby acknowledges
                        that any violation of the AUP by Customer shall entitle VoiceStack to terminate or suspend the Services
                        provided hereunder to customer. The AUP may be updated from time to time at the sole discretion of
                        VoiceStack. VoiceStack shall communicate any changes to the AUP and Customer may terminate this
                        agreement within 30 days of such communication if the changes to the AUP are not acceptable by the

                        are for normal, reasonable business use and consistent with the types and levels of usage by typical
                        customers using Services on same or similar plans. &quot;Typical&quot; refers to the calling patterns of
                        at least 95% of VoiceStack&rsquo;s Customers on the same or similar plan. Certain plans, including
                        unlimited call minutes, are designed for normal commercial use and are not intended to represent typical
                        usage by unique organizations such as call centers (other than the internal call centers inside a dental
                        practice), resellers, fax messaging services or telemarketing firms. Unauthorized or excessive use
                        beyond that Typical use may cause extreme network capacity and congestion issues for VoiceStack and
                        third-party networks. VoiceStack may suspend services in the event of unauthorized or excessive use.
                        Notwithstanding the above, Customer shall be considered in violation of this section if aggregate call
                        minutes for the Customer are more than 3000 minutes per User per calendar month.</span></li>
